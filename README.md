# 📘 ML Zoomcamp 2025 – Homework Solutions  

This repository contains my solutions from the **ML Zoomcamp 2025** by [DataTalks.Club](https://datatalks.club/).

📅 The 2025 cohort starts on **September 15th, 2025**. This repo will be updated weekly as I progress through the course and will provide solutions for this years cohort. There, you can check the material for this [seminar](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/machine-learning-zoomcamp).

├── .gitignore          <- File containing which files to be excluded from tracking
├── README.md           <- The project explanation file 
├── 01-week             <- The folder contain the solution for the 1st week
├── 02-week             <- The folder contain the solution for the 2nd week
└── 03-week             <- The folder contain the solution for the 3rd week
```

## 🏆 Certification  

Upon completing the course and the final project, I will receive a certificate of completion from **DataTalks.Club** (ML Zoomcamp 2025).  

## 🔮 Future Work  

- ✅ This repository will focus on **weekly homework solutions**.  
- 🔜 Larger projects (midterm & final) will be developed as **separate repositories** and later linked here for completeness.  

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This repository is a work in progress as I follow the ML Zoomcamp 2025. Solutions may evolve or be updated as I improve them throughout the course.
